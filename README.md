# Wishart-Volatility



## Introduction

This project consists on studying a model that allows us to consider the volatility of an asset as a stochastic process. This is of great interest because it allows us to reproduce well certain effects observed in the markets, such as the implied volatility smile and skew. In this repository, the model we chose for the volatility is the **Wishart Process**, the n-dimensional version of the *Heston* model. 



## Goal

To understand and simulate the price of an asset under the assumption that this asset's volatility is stochastic, with brownian component correlated to the price's brownian component. Secondly, we will calibrate this model with market data, more precisely, Call/Put options from the FX market.  



## What you will find

You will find codes that try to simulate this process, as well as calibrate the model with the help of some market data. Everything is in python, the only requisite is to install the following libraries
